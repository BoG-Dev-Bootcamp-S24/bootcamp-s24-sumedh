                    <h2>Cheetahs Fact #1</h2>
                    <p>Cheetahs are the fastest land animals in the world. They can reach speeds of 60-70 mph in short bursts. Their bodies are built for speed - long legs, slim build, flexible spine, large nostrils, and a heart and lungs that work together to circulate oxygen more efficiently.</p>

                    <h2>Cheetahs Fact #2</h2>
                    <p>Cheetahs are the only big cats that can't roar. They can purr though, which they use to communicate with each other. Their vocalizations include yelps, growls, chirps and hisses.</p>

                    <h2>Cheetahs Fact #3</h2>
                    <p>Cheetahs have unique black "tear lines" that run from the inner corner of each eye down to the mouth. These are thought to help reflect the sun's glare and improve daytime vision. They also have semi-retractable claws used for traction and gripping prey.</p>

            <p>Cheetahs live a fascinating, but fleeting, life. Reaching maturity around 2-3 years old, these spotted sprinters typically tip the scales between 40-70 kilograms (88-154 pounds), with males on the higher end. Despite their slender build, they pack some serious punch with a bite force around 3,100 newtons, comparable to a lion! But speed reigns supreme in their world. </p>
